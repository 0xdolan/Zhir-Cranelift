## Products we will work on:

### Kurdish OCR

We are using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for the OCR. Over the years we have collected [a lot of data](https://github.com/developerstree/kurdishresources) for the Kurdish languages. Because each language has its own model, we can documents in multiple languages. We plan to develop two models for the Kurdish langauge:

- A model for printed documents
- A model for manuscripts

Although the manuscript model is more useful, the printed documents model is easier and allows us to have a product ready to  in less time. There is already [a sample model](https://github.com/Shreeshrii/tesstrain-ckb) for the Kurdish language that has been trained using various fonts.

### Kurdish Audio transcription (Speech To Text)

We are going to use Mozilla [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).
